## Introduction

**Please be advised that this project is presently in BETA, thereby it will be updated accordingly.**

## Extensions

* [**Chromodynamics Theme**]: A **VSCode plugin** extends **Python programming** in **VSCode** through *a highly recommended (at least, from yours truly!)* **dark color scheme** from [**MagicStack**](https://github.com/MagicStack).  **Note:** This works well with [**MagicPython**](https://github.com/MagicStack/MagicPython), which is included below.  :-)

* [**Python**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python): An official **Microsoft VSCode plugin** that provides support for the **Python programming language** albeit for all actively supported **versions**: **2.7, >=3.6**, including **Functionalities**, such as:

  * IntelliSense
  
  * Linting
  
  * Debugging

  * Code Formatting
  
  * [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://jupyter.org/) Support
  
  * Refactoring
  
  * Variable Explorer
  
  * Test Explorer
  
  * Snippets
  
 * **Note**: Please be advised that you will need a **Python** distribution.  Depending on what you utilize Python programming for, I can recommend without hesitation either the official [**Python Distribution**](https://www.python.org/) or [**Anaconda**](https://www.anaconda.com/).  **Anaconda** graphical user interace is best for **data science**, **artificial intelligence**, and **machine learning**.  Conversely, the official **Python** distribution is best for application development (desktop, web, or GIS).  I have included the weblinks to the respective homepages, since usually pages are moved and the direct weblink would be dead.  :-(

* [**MagicPython**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=magicstack.MagicPython): A **VSCode plugin** that supports **preferences** and **syntax highlighter** for "cutting edge" **Python 3**, whereby serving as a **drop-in replacement** for the default **Python package**.

Moreover, this plugin can  be used in [**Live Share**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) **sessions** by installing the [**Test Explorer Live Share**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-test-explorer-liveshare) plugin.  No worries, this **Extension Pack** got you've covered. :)
