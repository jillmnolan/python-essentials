# README

## Introduction

Are you tired of reinstalling extensions on each of your computer(s)? How about when you have to reset computer entirely? Or, how about you're an instructor, a hobbyist, or just "getting your feet wet" in the fine craft of Python programming who does not know which extension(s) to select to get the job done both efficiently and effectively. Regardless, please do not waste time and energy on something so tedious as a process of installing extensions. Extensions are, in a word, awesome! Their premise is to extend the features and functionality of Visual Studio Code.

## What extensions will I get by selecting this extension pack?

Glad, that you've asked! Please find the supervening extensions. Of course, I always love to hear your suggestions to improve this extension package.  To do so, please create a new issue in the [**Issues Section**](https://github.com/jillmnolan/python-essentials/issues). After all, the ultimate goal for this extension pack is **convenience** at the click of one button. 

* [**Chromodynamics Theme**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=magicstack.Chromodynamics): A **VSCode plugin** extends **Python programming** in **VSCode** through *a highly recommended (at least, from yours truly!)* **dark color scheme** from [**MagicStack**](https://github.com/MagicStack).  **Note:** This works well with [**MagicPython**](https://github.com/MagicStack/MagicPython), which is included below.  :-)

* [**Python**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python): An official **Microsoft VSCode plugin** that provides support for the **Python programming language** albeit for all actively supported **versions**: **2.7, >=3.6**, including **Functionalities**, such as:

  * IntelliSense
  
  * Linting
  
  * Debugging
  
  * Code Navigation
  
  * Code Formatting
  
  * [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://jupyter.org/) Support
  
  * Refactoring
  
  * Variable Explorer
  
  * Test Explorer
  
  * Snippets
  
 * **Note**: Please be advised that you will need a **Python** distribution.  Depending on what you utilize Python programming for, I can recommend without hesitation either the official [**Python Distribution**](https://www.python.org/) or [**Anaconda**](https://www.anaconda.com/).  **Anaconda** graphical user interace is best for **data science**, **artificial intelligence**, and **machine learning**.  Conversely, the official **Python** distribution is best for application development (desktop, web, or GIS).  I have included the weblinks to the respective homepages, since usually pages are moved and the direct weblink would be dead.  :-(

* [**MagicPython**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=magicstack.MagicPython): A **VSCode plugin** that supports **preferences** and **syntax highlighter** for "cutting edge" **Python 3**, whereby serving as a **drop-in replacement** for the default **Python package**.

* [**Test Explorer UI**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-test-explorer): A **VSCode plugin** provides an extensible user interface for running tests. **Note**: This plugin works with a corresponding **Test Adapter** plugin, which for this extension pack is: [**Python Test Explorer for VSCode**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LittleFoxTeam.vscode-python-test-adapter).  Moreover, this plugin can  be used in [**Live Share**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) **sessions** by installing the [**Test Explorer Live Share**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-test-explorer-liveshare) plugin.
