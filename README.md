# Python Essentials, a Visual Studio Code extension package for Python Development

## Introduction

Are you tired of reinstalling extensions on each of your computer(s)? How about when you have to reset computer entirely? Or, how about you're an instructor, a hobbyist, or just "getting your feet wet" in the fine craft of Python programming who does not know which extension(s) to select to get the job done both efficiently and effectively. Regardless, please do not waste time and energy on something so tedious as a process of installing extensions. Extensions are, in a word, awesome! Their premise is to extend the features and functionality of Visual Studio Code.

## What extensions will I get by selecting this extension pack?

Glad, that you've asked! Please find the supervening extensions. Of course, I always love to hear your suggestions to improve this extension package.  To do so, please create a new issue in the [**Issues Section**](https://github.com/jillmnolan/python-essentials/issues). After all, the ultimate goal for this extension pack is **convenience** at the click of one button.
